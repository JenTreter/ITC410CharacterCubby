  "description": "I'm going to create a custom character template builder website, called \"Character Cubby.\" Character Cubby will allow users to create a character template with various attributes (i.e. name, stats, pictures) that can be published and then filled out with specific character instances of that template. This will enable people to create and share custom biography pages for their original characters while avoiding reptitive and time-consuming template creation and use such as seen on toyhou.se, Google Sheets, and other less-specialized custom website builders.",
