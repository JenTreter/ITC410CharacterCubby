# Semester Project Proposal

I'm going to create a custom character template builder website, called "Character Cubby." Character Cubby will allow users to create a character template with various attributes (i.e. name, stats, pictures) that can be published and then filled out with specific character instances of that template. This will enable people to create and share custom biography pages for their original characters while avoiding reptitive and time-consuming template creation and use such as seen on toyhou.se, Google Sheets, and other less-specialized custom website builders. 

Users will be able to create character templates that they can create, edit, delete, and use to create their own instances of that template that will be displayed on Character Cubby. Templates can be made either private (personal use only), shared (with certain other users), or public (free to be used by any user). Created character instances can also be private, shared, or public for other users to view. Only the creator of a template or character instance may edit it. 

Character Cubby will have a page for users to conveniently view all of the templates they've created, and the characters that they've made with those templates. There will be grouping, filtering, and sort options to allow users to easily view certain characters as fits their current use case.
